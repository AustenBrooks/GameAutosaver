# GameAutosaver
Java program to automatically create autosaves for games that don't support having multiple saves so you can manually load a save if you run into any bugs (or just want to savescum).

The code only copies a single file to a specified output folder at a specified interval, and will keep a specified number of autosaves in the output folder. It should be fairly simple to adjust the code to copy multiple files or an entire directory if required by the game.

Includes java source code as well as a compiled jar and an example .bat file for BG3 Honour mode.
