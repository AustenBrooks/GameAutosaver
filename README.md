# GameAutosaver
Java program to automatically create autosaves for games that don't support having multiple saves so you can manually load a save if you run into any bugs (or just want to savescum).

Now supports copying multiple files to an autosave folder, shoutout dragons dogma 2 for making me add support for this when I accidently loaded an inn save to deal with a bug and lost a couple hours of progress.

Includes java source code as well as a compiled jar and an example .bat file for BG3 Honour mode/DD2.
